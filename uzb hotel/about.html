          The Uzbekistan Hotel is the legendary hotel, which has been receiving guests for more than thirty years, and
          can
          be considered as one of the symbols of the capital.
        </p>
        <p>
          The multistorey building of the hotel, resembling a book by its shape, is located in the heart of the capital.
          There is the wonderful view of Amir Temur Square from windows of the hotel.

        It was a pleasure staying at this Brand new property, which is 5 minutes walking from the Mall. It is a nice
        hotel with excellent food and service. They offer complementary fruit, chocolates and coffee in the room.
